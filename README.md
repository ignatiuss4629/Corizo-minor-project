This CRUD application is a web-based project built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB Atlas as the backend database. It enables users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations seamlessly while maintaining a dynamic and interactive user interface. Through this project, I learned essential backend development concepts, such as handling RESTful APIs, managing database connections with MongoDB Atlas, and rendering dynamic content using EJS templates. The application follows a structured approach to database interactions, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, it is designed to integrate clean Bootstrap styling for an enhanced user experience. This project has strengthened my understanding of MongoDB queries, Express routing, and practical troubleshooting techniques, making it a significant step forward in my backend development journey. I plan to share this project in my GitHub repository to showcase my skills and invite contributions from the developer community
